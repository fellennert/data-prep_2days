# Intro

![](figures/kondo_tidy.png)

## Why this course?

-   Data data data

    ![](figures/bail_data.png)

## Why this course

-   Data are "the new oil"
-   ... but just like crude oil is unusable, they have to be refined to be of value

## Why R?

-   R and RStudio cover the entire process of data science

## Why R?

::: incremental
-   Community-based & for free

-   The former means:

    -   Lots of different packages

    -   Plenty of support

-   The latter implies:

    -   Universities save a bunch of money

    -   Companies as well

    -   Arguably impacts: reproducibility, job perspectives
:::

## Why R?

-   Facilitates reproducible science

![](figures/replication_crisis.png)

-   R -- or open-source scripting languages in general - may alleviate that

    -   A recent example: [Petter Törnberg's paper](https://github.com/cssmodels/tornberg2022pnas)

## Why R?

::: incremental
-   Flexibility

    -   there are tons of packages available

    -   if nothing suits you, you can modify whatever package or function you want
:::

## Why R?

-   Job perspectives in the private sector

## Why R?

-   Job perspectives in academia

## Who am I?

-   B.A. Political Science (2018), University of Regensburg

    -   "Classic" PolSci education, focus on empirical social science research
    -   Exposure to "classic" methods -- working with survey data, different flavors of regressions, a bit of qualitative research
    -   Eventually, got a bit into more avantgardistic approaches of doing social science, Bachelor's thesis was a network analysis of politicians' Twittering behavior

## Who am I?

-   M.Sc. Computational Social Science (2021), Linköping University

    -   Thorough introduction to how to harness large scale digital data to assess and describe human behavior

    -   Also: training in "analytical sociology" - goal is to find, formulate, and test durable mechanisms that govern human behavior and structure societies

    -   RA in [a project on text mining](https://liu.se/en/research/computational-text-analysis)

## Who am I?

-   Currently: Ph.D. at Institute Polytechnique de Paris (supervisor: Étienne Ollion, prospective finishing date: 2024)

    -   Assessing public opinion dynamics in France

    -   Working with large-scale textual data (newspaper archives)

    -   We also organized [a little summer school](https://sicss.io/2022/paris/)

## Who are you?

A couple of sentences on your...

-   Background

-   Current position

-   Research interests

-   What you expect from the course

# Housekeeping

## What to expect

-   At the beginning of every project stands a non-negligible amount of data inspection, cleaning, and transformation

-   R and the `tidyverse` packages can decisively facilitate that

## Schedule

-   22/11
    -   9:30-12:00: intro + the rationale behind tidy data + RStudio projects + the pipe

    -   13:00-15:00: data transformation (`dplyr`)

    -   15:15-16:00: categorical data (`forcats`) + dates (`lubridate`)
-   23/11
    -   9:30-10:00: recap
    -   10:00-13:00: data visualization (`ggplot2`) + exercises

## Teaching rationale

"Classic" R courses...

-   usually try to show you very few functions

-   ... and then have you do exercises that cover a very basic and narrow use case.

In my opinion, this sucks as there is a small chance that the problems you may encounter in the wild can be solved with the small set of tools you have heard of so far.

## Teaching rationale

Hence, this course...

-   ...aims to expose you to a very broad set of functions and tools

-   ...will move comparably fast

-   ...will be published for open access with fully reproducible code and a comprehensive description of the functions and operations that are performed, so that you can revisit the material when you actually need it

-   ...will include extensive lists of further resources to facilitate your further endeavoRs
